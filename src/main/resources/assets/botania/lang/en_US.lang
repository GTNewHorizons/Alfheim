botania.tagline.alfheim=New Horizons!
botania.page.alfheim0=&oAlfheim... A beautiful world where magic lives forever... These lands were given to the light alvs, also called elves. But who are they? Creatures similar to humans living for so long that they deserve to be considered immortal, they were created by the first Æsir. The very same world is filled with special magic, which made the world so beautiful.&0
botania.page.alfheim1=&oBut it also has terrible characteristics: time. Even the time itself in this place is distorted. Many legends go about this place: those who once came to Alfheim, returned from it after decades, although for them the days passed... Those that the travelers knew happened to have been in Helheim or Walhall for a long time... Oh, let the heavenly light shines upon the souls of the dead!&0

botania.entry.anomaly=Anomalies
botania.tagline.anomaly=The dangers of this world
botania.page.anomaly0=&oWe all know that in the past, Alfheim, like the other worlds, suffered from The Shattering. And since this event was not only physical, but magical in nature, it is clear that anomalies were formed in the world.&0
botania.page.anomalyManaVoid.t=&1Manavortex&0
botania.page.anomalyManaVoid.d=Pulls &4Mana&0 from players nearby. One brave man decided to check how much it could hold. Gained a lot of mana and came closer to it. According to the observers, after about a minute the vortex &4exploded&0, killing the experimenter on the spot, and a huge sphere of mana flew in it's direction.
botania.page.anomalySpeedUp.t=&1Accelerator&0
botania.page.anomalySpeedUp.d=A very rare anomaly, it is capable of twice accelerating all creatures and some mechanisms, like furnaces within its radius of action. Some lucky ones who have found such an anomaly build their houses right next to it, significantly speeding up their flower meadows.
botania.page.anomalyWarp.t=&1Warp&0
botania.page.anomalyWarp.d=Probably the most easily recognizable anomaly. If you see a bunch of randomly floating blocks - this is the &1Warp&0. It is very dangerous for singles, as it can easily imprint into the block, therefore, in order to successfully pass through it, it is worth walking in pairs, since then it simply swaps the travelers in places.
botania.page.anomalyAntigrav.t=&1Antigravity&0
botania.page.anomalyAntigrav.d=A relatively safe anomaly, often used as large lifts or, if there is a reservoir next to it, for diving from a height. Fortunately, in order to lift the blocks it does not have enough strength.
botania.page.anomalyLightning.t=&1Clot of Dark Energy&0
botania.page.anomalyLightning.du=Attacks by electrical discharges all living things that are within reach, and the closer an object is found, the stronger the hit it receives. Strangely reacts on &1Gaia Spirits&0 nearby. Perhaps it can somehow be used.
botania.page.anomalyLightning.d=Attacks by electrical discharges all living things that are within reach, and the closer an object is found, the stronger the hit it receives. In practice, used to create &4Anti-pylons&0
botania.page.anomalyManaTornado.t=&1Mana Thunder&0
botania.page.anomalyManaTornado.d=Every few seconds, shoots randomly directed &1Mana burst&0 with a random effect. Sometimes this can even lead to an explosion at the point where the burst hits the surface.
botania.page.anomalyGravity.t=&1Gravity Vortex&0
botania.page.anomalyGravity.d=The field of alternating gravity, dragging all the objects to it. If you got into the zone of its action, then your only way to get out is to run in the opposite direction, otherwise you can stay there forever. Does not act on the blocks.

botania.entry.elves=Elves
botania.tagline.elves=Native inhabitants
botania.page.elves0=As it was said before, elves are beautiful creatures, spellfully wielding magic, which the first &4Æsir&0 settled in &4Alfheim&0. A great sorcerer and Alfheim-born &6Mastray&0 was the only one who knew the temporary anomalies of his own world as his five fingers.
botania.page.elves1=His greatest invention was the portal to &4Midgard&0, the middle world of the world tree &4Yggdrasil&0. This world was not like &4Alfheim&0. He studied this world for a week on the &4Midgard&0 calendar, and during this time met humans. Those only heard about the elven kingdom, but now they are eager to get there...
botania.page.elves2=&6Mastray&0 warned them about the time jump that they will have to endure, and almost everyone listened to his warnings... 30 years passed on &4Midgard&0, on &4Alfhem&0 - only 7 hours. But they were warned, what is their punishment from themselves!
botania.page.elves3=After this incident, the elves sought the most stable lands in their kingdom. In those, when one second passes in &4Alfhem&0, a little more than an hour passes in &4Midgard&0. So then the great cooperation of elves and humans began!
botania.page.elves4=Among the humans there were mages who comprehended their craft through flowers. This magic was something similar to elven one. Having studied the precious component of &4Midgard&0 ores (iron, diamonds and similar jewelry) elves understood that bargaining with humans is profitable. However, their world is not filled with mana like &4Alfheim&0. Therefore, they concluded a trade union, which is still valid today.

botania.entry.pylons=New pylons
botania.tagline.pylons=I will command the parade
botania.page.pylons0=There are some changes in pylons you need to get used to:<br>All &4Midgard&0 pylons has their counterparts in &4Alfheim&0: &1Elven pylon&0 is same tier as &1Mana pylon&0; &1Yordin pylon&0 - as &1Natura pylon&0;<br>&1Gaia pylon&0 is still top-tier, but it's recipe has changed.

botania.entry.portal=Portal to Alfheim
botania.tagline.portal=We need to go even more deeper!
botania.page.portal0=&6Mastray&0... He was a native of &4Alfheim&0 and created the first portal to &4Midgard&0, which laid the foundation for a great alliance. However, the portal itself was given to him with great difficulty. To build a portal there, some resources of &4Midgard&0 were needed... How ironic... It's good that &6Freyr&0 himself lived in &4Alfheim&0, because he was a race of &4Vanir&0, another kind of gods...
botania.page.portal1=He understood &6Mastray&0, and brought him &1Terrasteel&0 - the great alloy of &4Midgard&0. After that he quickly finished the portal and activated it. Apparently, if you build it in &4Midgard&0, it will also work...
botania.page.portal2=At the heart of the portal is &4Bifröst&0 - the legendary rainbow bridge that connects &4Asgard&0 to other worlds.
botania.page.portal3=Creating &1Alfheim Portal Core&0
botania.page.portal4=The next thing you need is a link that can set up the perfect connection between &4Alfheim&0 and &4Midgard&0. Elves will never tell the secret of making this link to humans, and for its manufacture will require the &1Netherstar&0 - the artifact of &4Muspelheim&0. It remains only to build the portal correctly and it's ready!
botania.page.portal5=Creating &1Interdimensional Gateway Core&0
botania.page.portal6=Portal to Alfheim
botania.page.portal7=To activate the portal, you only need to use the &1Core&0 on the portal, and operating principle is identical to the portal of livingwood. The only difference is that in &4Alfheim&0 it doesn't require &4Mana&0 sources, since it takes energy from the world itself.
botania.page.portal8=Unfortunately, it was impossible to create a stable and fully functioning portal even for &6Mastray&0. This version can no longer pass the inanimate objects, only beings mentally connected with higher creatures - players. But it successfully compensates temporal anomalies of &4Alfheim&0 at the price of its integrity if it is not in the center of the world.
botania.page.portal8s=Unfortunately, it was impossible to create a stable and fully functioning portal even for &6Mastray&0.

botania.page.worldgen3=Also in the world you can find ruins, for example, places of battles with the Guardian of Gaia, that's how the elves received his essences... <br>The sand of this world is not like the sand of Midgard... Perhaps it can be used to make something interesting.

botania.tagline.shrines=Praise the Sun!
botania.page.shrines0=Traveling around the Alfheim, one can notice different small-scaled ruins, looking like specific temples. Those are called Shrines of Power. In every shrine there is a place to pray to ancient gods - &1Stones of Power&0. Using such stones, one can gain some temporal paired-effect buffs at a cost of some &4Mana&0, to increase one skill by decreasing another. Those are not combinable.
botania.page.shrines1=&4Berserk&0 - gain attack damage, lose health points.<br>&4Overmage&0 - gain magic attack damage, lose mana.<br>&4Ninja&0 - gain speed, lose attack damage.<br>&4Tank&0 - gain protection, lose speed

botania.entry.flowerEnderchid=Orechid Endium
botania.tagline.flowerEnderchid=Creates End ores from End Stone
botania.page.flowerEnderchid0=The &1Orechid&0 is a great flower. The ability to create raw ores with &4Mana&0 can be a great boon to any sedentary botanist's life. It, however, can't create ores from the &4End&0. Getting that sorted out is easy, by switching the petals a bit, it'll create &4End&0 ores in &1End Stone&0 instead. The flower must be in &4The End&0 to function.

botania.page.flowerSnow0=&1Scurrocallis&0 is an alternative to &4Rainaria&0 but for snow biomes. You know why this is a thing....
botania.page.flowerSnow1=Cold to the touch!

botania.entry.flowerStorm=Thunderbloom
botania.tagline.flowerStorm=Produces mana from lightning
botania.page.flowerStorm0=&1Thunderbloom&0 is another weather-dependent flower except this one isn't a passive one. It generates mana when a lightning strickes it. Afterwards generates a lot of mana. This process heats the flower and it needs &4roughly a minute&0 to cool down.
botania.page.flowerStorm1=Essentially an energy converter!

botania.entry.flowerWind=Windifolia
botania.tagline.flowerWind=Produces mana from wind
botania.page.flowerWind0=When placed in the open, the &1Windifolia&0 creates &4Mana&0 from wind. The higher it is, the more mana it produces. More mana can be get under rain. Since it is a passive flower, it will decay.
botania.page.flowerWind1=Only the storms can knock down the trees.

botania.entry.ores=Ores
botania.tagline.ores=Make even more filters...
botania.page.ores0=Everyone knows that the midges of Midgard are filled with ores and minerals. This is clearly seen when miners extract new pieces of iron, gold or diamonds. However, what about Alfheim? They have their own ores that they traded with the people of Midgard.<br>Elementium ore is a magical metal ore that is pure and beautiful... Stunning metal!
botania.page.ores1=Dragonstone ore - precious pink elven jewel. It is a pity that you can not make the tools out of it.<br>Gold ore - looks like the elves had the metal of the gods too...<br>Elven quartz ore - it's like the quartz from the nether, a beautiful green color, like Alfheim itself!
botania.page.ores2=Iffesal ore - only a few people have heard about it. It is believed that its dust has a great power, and greatest elven inventions are based on it. Elves themselves are aware of human's greed and profit thirst, so they don't want to bargain with it.<br>Lapis lazuli ore - not so beautiful as Dragonstone, but still charming.

botania.entry.mobs=Mobs
botania.tagline.mobs=Finally, life!
botania.page.mobs0=Alfheim, unlike Midgard, is not such a forgotten world. After all, there still live indigenous people - elves! It's good that they haven't lost their mind, otherwise we know the former natives of Midgard - zombies. Elves are the greatest sorcerers, and they are revered by everyone. They were, it until they got infected with that terrible virus... But somehow they are not inclined to talk with you...
botania.page.mobs1=Also in the world can fly special little purple creatures, which are called pixies, otherwise - fairies. Kind - yes. Valuable - yes, because their dust is used in various crafting recipes. Elves used this ingredient to trade it for manapearls...

botania.entry.pixie=Pixie Attaractor

But not more! &1Rod of the Green Hills&0 will replace all &1earth&0, &1mycelium&0 and &1podzol&0 on the air with &1grass&0 in exchange for some &4Mana&0. If those blocks are underground, process will cost a little bit more.

botania.entry.rodClick=Rod of the High Will
botania.tagline.rodClick=Artificial interaction wand
botania.page.rodClick0=The &1Rod of the High Will&0 was created to simulate the LMB and RMB clicks that the player makes when interacting with any devices and creatures. The wand does not have any functionality that could be used directly by the player, so a &1Livingwood Avatar&0 is required for its work.
botania.page.rodClick1=An avatar can interact with anything through the block in front of him and to the block below. To interact with items, the avatar needs any block underneath that is an inventory. To simulate the pressed Shift key, any block must be placed above the avatar.
botania.page.rodClick2=The delay between uses is inversely proportional to the level of the redstone signal applied to it - the higher the signal level, the lower the delay. Of course, for each of its actions, the avatar consumes a certain amount of &4mana&0.
botania.page.rodClick3=Everything is in his hands

botania.tagline.lootInt=No more littered inventories!
botania.page.lootInt0=By upgrading &1Black Hole Talisman&0 with some &1Iffesal Dust&0 one can create a sort of handy trashcan, which can consume not only block, but items from your inventory and shatter them into some amount of &4Mana&0. Put unwanted items in crafting grid alongside with &1Interceptor&0 to setup destroy filter (only &4ID&0 and &4Metadata&0 sensitive). Put it to empty grid to clear filter.

botania.page.lembas1=As a new use for sweet nectar, something similar was invented by elven travelers. On long journeys and when crossing mountain peaks, every seasoned adventurer must take with him a nutritious sweet bread - &1Elven Lembas&0. It is very easy to prepare and thanks to its grape leaves it never spoils.

botania.page.corpSeq1=First of all, the Sequencer must be connected to the &4Corporea network&0 using the &1Corporea spark&0. The request template is placed in the inventory above the Sequencer, and the requested item is placed in a frame on the Sequencer as a filter. Items from the template are placed in the inventory located two blocks below the Sequencer.
botania.page.corpSeq2=For use in crafting automation, the number of items created per request is configured by clicking LMB and Shift-LMB. Pressing RMB with the staff of the forest on the Sequencer will reset the current request, and giving a redstone pulse will repeat the request for the expected item.

botania.page.infuser0=Basic filling with mana is the basis of all botanical magic. Is it difficult to just throw an item in the mana pool to just fill it? Everyone will say at once: it's easy! However, the elves went further. Their goal was to create a special device that allows filling one object with the properties of others and mana. Just like Thaumaturges of Midgard.
botania.page.infuser1=Nevertheless, this required the most valuable dust - the Iffesal. It doesn't just symbolize power - it IS power, but in a crystallized form. What about pixies dust? It is the basis of what was called the core of the mana-infuser.

However, long before that, elves had a similar method of making an alloy woven from the power of Alfheim's resources. By properties, it is similar to terrasteel, but stronger...

botania.page.trade0=Alfheim sometimes impresses with its anomalies, but precisely because of them it is possible to create a portal into this world. The trading gate used by the traders of Midgard is built in Alfheim in a different way, because of those anomalies not allowing the work of a scheme that operates in Overworld. But Mastray did not lose it.
botania.page.trade1=The Alfheim-Midgard portal itself is similar in design to the portal of Midgard-Alfheim, but there are some differences:<br>The material for its gate won't be livingwood, but a livingrock, and elven pylons of elvorium and Iffesal dust will perfectly stabilize the connection.

botania.page.essences4=Terrasteel and Elvorium are ideal alloys, symbolizing the power of Midgard and Alfheim. But it's still far from the limit! We all know what will happen if we combine the Gaia Spirit and the Terrestrial - Gaia ingot. A dummy, it would seem. But the elves consider differently...
botania.page.essences5=Legends of Asgard say: the weapons of the gods are woven of a special metal, uniting the forces of the four worlds. The elves took into account these legends and decided to become like the gods in this. They have woven two alloys from the elvorium and essences of the primal worlds, similarly to Gaia ingots: an ingots of Muspelheim's and Niflheim's powers.

The elves strengthened this stone with the valuable Iffesal dust, and created a mana-stone that allows you to store mana four times more than that stone tablet.

botania.page.ruling1=Using the Mauftrium and Blazerods, the Elves were able to concentrate the power of the runes and use it to their advantage. The rods of two worlds allow the creation of protective circles - from the red flame of Muspelheim or the poisonous ice of Niflheim.

Fortunately this problem is solvable with the use of the alloy of the gods! The sword itself can either be a simple cutting blade, or it can erupt from itself the strength of one of the four primal elements.
botania.page.reality1=But we must take into account that when you set the sword to one of these elements, mana is wasted, so take care of it! But it's not important, because you have a lot of it, considering that you created so much Mauftrium for this sword, right?

But what about the practical part? For example, if someone need to automate the direct transfer of mana from one storage to another at such distances that no spreader could reach it?
botania.page.manaImba1=And there is no reason to talk about interdimensional mana transfer - every human sorcerer will look at you as insane for mentioning this one thought. But not the elves, for their ancestral home stores valuable &1Iffesal dust&0 under the ground. This blue treasure is the key to solving the eternal problem of mana mechanics: incomparable space-bending capability allows reaching any branch of Yggdrasil, and even further.
botania.page.manaImba2=To select any &1Mana pool&0 as transfer target simply sneak-rightclick it with &1Transmitter&0. Then set the pool to mana accepting mode. Now place transmitter on &1Mana accelerator&0 above any filled mana pool - it will be the source pool.

And these properties were not missed by one of the students of Mastray while helping the teacher in his researches. He suggested that since single Gaia Spirit is capable of significantly enhancing regular mana spreader, then what will happen if you make a second improvement using Mauftrum?
botania.page.uberSpreader1=After a series of experiments and several consultations with Dwarven masters, the result was obtained: &1Mauftrium mana spreader&0, many times stronger than its predecessor.

botania.entry.flugel=Flügel
botania.tagline.flugel=Weapon of Gods
botania.page.flugel0=Not much can be said about the Flügels. Angels of death - so they are called. Wayward, cruel and almost immortal. Their ability to teleport in the places they've seen previously has attracted many brave explorers, but not everyone decides to challenge Gaia's Guardian to get one of their eyes.
botania.page.flugel1=Flügels themselves strongly hate Guardians, for the fact that they took away eyes from their dead relatives, and are trying their best to return the relics. And it can be used to your advantage. Replacing the sacrificial ingot at the eye of the Flügel in the ritual of Gaia, built in the clouds, you can summon one of the Flügels and try to defeat it.
botania.page.flugel2=But be careful - their self-love will not allow them to fight with someone who can not fly by themselves, so you need to get wings like theirs. Good armor, strong sword and potions - without them you are unlikely to achieve anything. Otherwise, an inquisitive and flexible mind will help you.

botania.entry.soul=Flügel's Soul
botania.tagline.soul=God Slayers
botania.page.soul0=The one who win the Flügel will receive the highest reward - &1Flügel's soul&0, allowing to set up to twelve warp points, like an eye in the old days. But that's not all. If you want to test your forces on the limit - the soul will allow you to call another Flügel, even stronger - the one from Gods Slayers, twelve more times (in exchange for warp points). This will give you some useful and rare resources.
botania.page.soul1=However, some heroes began to run out of resources, which they managed to get from a limited number of opponents, so they asked omniscient Mastray for help. The sage spent several days in the library, studying archival records of past years, and exploring the structure of the soul. Finally, he returned the souls to the travelers and told one story:
botania.page.soul2=&oA few millennia ago, the Great War raged in the world, in which the nations of all worlds fought. Among them were Flügels, ideal killing machines, especially for those creatures whose power went beyond the understanding of human and elven explorers. However, something even more terrible happened closer to the end of the war: The Shattering.&r
botania.page.soul3=&oJudging by the records at my disposal, the reason for this was the penetration through the fabric of reality of something alien, terrifying the gaze and mind of the one who looks at it... &4&oGinnungagap&0&o, the pristine abyss that could not resist the birth of the universe, striving only to reverse everything existing into true nothing.&r
botania.page.soul4=&oIt is not known how, but it took control of the Flügels, using their powers in it's desire for universal annihilation. Fortunately for us, although &4&oGinnungagap&0&o was strong, it was also ignorant of the laws of the universe, which gave the Alves and Vanir alliance an advantage in the battle with the Abyss puppets.&r
botania.page.soul5=&oBut there was another problem: due to the distortions generated by &4&oGinnungagap&0&o, anomalous zones began to appear in the world that did not yield to logic. And one of those zones were formed in the places of death of the Flügels that were under the control of the Abyss. Chaotic clumps of black energy attacking everything that comes close to them.&r
botania.page.soul6=&oOnly recently I managed to establish their nature - they were souls, unable to leave the world and crashed into the fabric of the universe forever. However, those souls are so dark that even the great magicians are not eager to poke them, not to mention attempts to use.&r
botania.page.soul7=&oFurther research has shown that nature's powerful source of energy can help you enclose the energy that is raging inside these anomalies. And if you manage to carry out its further purification by sacrificing the higher forces of nature, then it may happen that the souls in your hands will be restored by it...&r
botania.page.soul8=Pave &4Anti-pylons&0 around ritual of Gaia to form a ring with Gaia pylons, then place the Mana infuser and the botanical brewery over the beacon. Thus, the energy from the pylons will be concentrated in the infuser and will restore a part of the Flügel's soul with final hit.
botania.page.soul9=Soul restructurizer
botania.page.soul10=In order to restore the soul, it is enough to place it in the upper part of the brewery and summon the Gaia Guardian. Anti-pylons will do the rest for you. For sure success, call the hardcore form of the Guardian. But if you are lucky, then the usual form will help, it is like a coin toss. But be careful. If you make a mistake, the accumulated energy will be released into space in the form of an explosion.
botania.page.soul11=Rinse And Repeat

botania.entry.soulHorn=Horn of Souls
botania.tagline.soulHorn=Flügel: Ultramode activated
botania.page.soulHorn0=Watching how much stronger Flügel is invoked due to only one spent fragment of the soul, you were struck by a thought as if a lightning strike. What happens if you try to bring more fragments to the ritual of summoning? Or the whole soul at once? Of course, it is impossible to put such an idea into practice unless you create some kind of artifact.
botania.page.soulHorn1=Remembering the intoxicating power of &1Mauftrium&0 and the ability of &1Elvorium&0 to contain a huge amount of energy, the image of &1Horn of Souls&0 was opened to your eyes. It works on the principle of a funnel: all soul fragments placed in it merge into a single vessel of energy and are used to invoke an incomprehensibly powerful creature. After direct use, the horn loses all the stored energy, but not utility.

botania.entry.stories=Token of Banter
botania.tagline.stories=Yet knowledge can be bought
botania.page.stories0=Centuries have passed since the inhabitants of &4Alfheim&0 and &4Midgard&0 established close trade relations. Midgard adventurers, researchers and sages, like &6Mastrei&0, sought to learn all elven secrets in order to improve their own technologies, to become rich and famous. The most zealous of them was alchemist &6Tywin&0, who invented &1Token of Banter&0 - a symbol of knowledge accumulated over decades of his life.
botania.page.stories1=He managed to negotiate with the elven elders on mutually beneficial exchange of information: &6Tywin&0 provides a piece of his alchemical research, sealed in a coin, and the elves - the secrets and teachings of his people. So, why would the wisest elders need the knowledge of the Midgard alchemist?
botania.page.stories2=Everything is simpler than it might seem at first glance. Elves have always sought to rise above other sentient beings, and the straight road to this is knowledge, not only their own, but also foreign to them before. So, through the centuries, there was an exchange of accumulated knowledge between the worlds of humans and elves.
botania.page.stories3=Until something unimaginable happened on one rather ordinary day: a student of &6Tywin&0 betrayed his mentor, distributing &1Tokens of banter&0 over &4Midgard&0. As a result of this foolish act they were all lost over time.

botania.entry.winery=Winery
botania.tagline.winery=Drink to every home
botania.page.winery0=Since ancient times, the craftsmen of Midgard have known the method of producing good wine, but no one of them dares to be proud of this fact, one has only to taste the results of labor and magic of the elves.
botania.page.winery1=Of course, being a rather cunning and resourceful race, humans were able to negotiate with the elven winemakers about mutually beneficial instruction of their disciples, but the terms of this agreement remain a mystery to most races. It is only known that on the first day of training, the masters tell their students a story...
botania.page.winery2=Just a story, but, as the students themselves say after returning home, this is enough to make wine of the highest quality by the standards of Midgard. Of course, if the student listened attentively and did not ask stupid questions like: “Why is white wine made from green grapes?”, the answer is very simple...
botania.page.winery3=Mastray learned this story, though not firsthand, so it is available to people only in the following form:
botania.page.winery4=&oOnce, a dwarf meadbrewer was wandering across the expanses of the eastern plains in search of new plants for its mead. He was tired of mead from herbs and flowers, whose bitterness was softened only by a solid piece of freshly cooked beef. And the dwarf decided to try something new in his craft.&0
botania.page.winery5=&oHe has long laid eyes on the grape bushes growing here - under old trees, or there - on the water surfaces of rivers, sparkling under the rays of the sun with red and green tints. But no matter how hard the dwarf meadbrewer tried, nothing worthwhile came out of it...&0
botania.page.winery6=&oThe mead was either too sour or too bland. Something sugary was missing that would dilute the drink with new colors... Not a single month was spent by the dwarf in vain attempts to find the coveted ingredient.&0
botania.page.winery7=&oUntil one day his most zealous student brought a drop of nectar that butterflies carry from flower to flower in the vast expanses of Alfheim, making its taste so multifaceted, but at the same time making it difficult to dissolve in water.&0
botania.page.winery8=&oThe dwarf, imbued with the desire of his student, decided to try an unconventional way of preparing the drink. He put together a barrel from the oldest oak, which has acquired a dark wood color over the centuries, filled the barrel with a dozen bunches of grapes, instructed the student to jump a little in the barrel to squeeze out all the juice from the berries...&0
botania.page.winery9=&oThen he added a drop of nectar and sealed the barrel for a while in his cellar. Amazingly, the very first experiment of the unsuccessful meadbrewer ended in success - the resulting drink had a noble sweet taste and unusual flavor.&0
botania.page.winery10=&oSince the new drink and the method of its preparation were completely different from mead, the dwarf gave it a new name, which in one of the forgotten languages means "Divine gift". And the only thought that did not leave the dwarf head was the preoccupation with the appropriate vessel for such a wonderful drink, but there was nothing better than wooden mugs at hand.&0
botania.page.winery11=Now, thanks to the artisans of Midgard, jugs made of baked clay are used to store wine.

alfheim.page.aurora0=By combining dirt with the shimmering essence of a &1Mana Pearl&0, you can make dirt that captures the threads of magic in the world, having a different color based on its location. This mystical dirt is also capable of growing trees and plants without water or a hoe. It can be converted back to regular dirt using a &1Pure Daisy&0.
alfheim.page.aurora1=Seek the hour of twilight in the forest of silence
alfheim.page.aurora2=Planks
alfheim.page.aurora3=Stairs
alfheim.page.aurora4=Slabs
alfheim.page.aurora5=And back again

alfheim.page.rodPrismatic0=One particularly frustrating property of the &1Mana Lens: Flash&0 is its tendency to lock the color of a &1Mana Flash&0 immidiately upon making it. Even if you want to make a rainbow &1Flash&0, you'll get one color. By using the power of the &1Rod of the Prismatic Lake&0, you can make the rainbow you've been searching for.<br>It can be tinged with &1Phantom Ink&0.
alfheim.page.rodPrismatic1=All the colors of the wind

alfheim.page.irisSapling0=Blessed by the goddess of rainbows, these saplings are made from their earthly counterparts by the purifying magic of a &1Pure Daisy&0. These saplings will only grow on &1Iridescent Dirt&0 and take on the hue of the dirt they lay their roots in.<br><br>They're just &oreally&0 big carnations
alfheim.page.irisSapling1=Planks
alfheim.page.irisSapling2=Stairs
alfheim.page.irisSapling3=Slabs
alfheim.page.irisSapling4=And back again
alfheim.page.irisSapling5=Grinding them down

alfheim.page.treeCrafting0=Affecting life is much harder than making or destroying it. The &1Iridescent Tree&0 has a natural lack of regular life, which lends itself to making beautiful spectrums of wood. It seems possible to re-add this life, by drawing mana into a &4Dendric Suffuser&0. This structure, of &1Obsidian&0 and materials of &4Iridesence&0, will suffuse the purified tree with life, creating interesting new varieties of life.
alfheim.page.treeCrafting1=When a &1Wand of the Forest&0 is used on the apex plank of the structure, it will complete it. For a tree to be made, you must plant a lifeless &1Iridescent Sapling&0 on the dirt below, and pump &4Mana&0 into the apex block. The components must be placed on the &1Item Platforms&0, and the crafting will begin on its own.
alfheim.page.treeCrafting2=The Dendric Suffuser

alfheim.page.irisSeeds0=If &1Bone Meal&0 is used on &1Iridescent Dirt&0, it will grow &1Iridescent Grass&0 instead of &1Tall Grass&0. When this &1Iridescent Grass&0 is thrown into a &4Mana Pool&0, you get out something quite like the &1Pasture Seed&0. It will transmute &1Grass&0 and &1Dirt&0 into &1Iridescent Dirt&0, with a simple right click.
alfheim.page.irisSeeds1=/etc/sudoers
alfheim.page.irisSeeds2=Tiger Orchid monoculture

alfheim.page.coatOfArms0=Much like &1Cosmetic Baubles&0, the &1Coat of Arms&0 can add a touch of style to any baubles a player has equipped. These can be worn as an &4Amulet&0, or crafted alongside another &4Bauble&0 much like &4Cosmetic Overrides&0.<br>Wearing a &1Coat of Arms&0 will act as a &1Clerical Colorizer&0, changing the color of any clerical abilities you might use so as to declare your allegiance.
alfheim.page.coatOfArms1=Papers, please

alfheim.page.colorOverride0=The &1Clerical Colorizer&0, the &4Ring&0 form of the &1Paintslinger's Lens&0 can change even the color of magic. Wearing one will affect any clerically aligned abilities, changing their color. These can be crafted alongside another &4Bauble&0 much like &4Cosmetic Overrides&0. They can by dyed much like leather with &1Floral Powder&0, and cleared by simply putting one in a crafting table.
alfheim.page.colorOverride1=Beware of the dark clerics

alfheim.page.sealCreepers0=The &4Manatide&0 flows throughout the world, but as with a river, there are always bumps and rapids. The &4Manaseal Creeper&0 is a walking rift in the flow of &4Mana&0. Should it explode near you, you'll find yourself stricken with a &4Manatide Storm&0, which will eat away at your mana, taking away what could be hours of generation. It's recommended to stay away from them at all costs.
alfheim.page.sealCreepers1Drop=However, they do have one interesting property. They crystallize their mana inside, occasionally resulting in a &1Black Lotus&0 found on their corpse. Their storming energy, combined with this crystallized mana, can react with fully-formed &1Loti&0. When a &4Manatide Storm&0 comes into contact with a &1Black Lotus&0, it will break their harmony and result in a &1Wilted Lotus&0, a powerful magical resource.
alfheim.page.sealCreepers1NoDrop=However, they do have one interesting property. Their storming energy can react with fully-formed &1Black Loti&0. When a &4Manatide Storm&0 comes into contact with one of these flowers, it will break their harmony and result in a &1Wilted Lotus&0, a powerful magical resource.

alfheim.page.kindling0=&1Blaze Kindling&0 is like &1Netherrack&0 on steroids. Not only will it sustain flames, but it can also be extinguished and lit simply by using it with an open hand. It also can be operated with redstone, but this is pretty tricky.
alfheim.page.kindling1=Stop drop and roll

alfheim.page.livingwoodFunnel0=For some people, the &1Hopper&0 is too lax. It allows items through when it shouldn't, and sometimes moves them too fast. The &1Livingwood Funnel&0 is far, far stricter. It only allows one item through at a time, and can be filtered by placing an &1Item Frame&0 on one of its sides.
alfheim.page.livingwoodFunnel1=One at a time, please

alfheim.page.itemDisplay0=The &1Item Platform&0 is a neat way to display an item without having it despawn. Giving it an item via right click or hopper will show it floating above the platform. It's a neat way to show off your piles of resources.
alfheim.page.itemDisplay1=Terrasteel makes you look rich

alfheim.page.lightningSapling0=The &1Thunderous Oak&0 is a tree that acts like a lightning rod. It absorbs lightning from the surrounding area and redirects it to itself. The process of drawing in the lightning can sometimes damage items and creatures, and light terrain on fire where the lightning was. The effect is reduced by the existence of the Oak, though.
alfheim.page.lightningSapling1=Thor will hate you
alfheim.page.lightningSapling2=Planks
alfheim.page.lightningSapling3=Stairs
alfheim.page.lightningSapling4=Slabs
alfheim.page.lightningSapling5=Twigs
alfheim.page.lightningSapling6=And splinters

alfheim.page.infernalSapling0=The &1Infernal Oak&0 is a tree so saturated with fire energy, it repulses external flames. Its leaves, logs, and planks are all completely immune to conventional flames.
alfheim.page.infernalSapling1=Just pour more fire on it, it'll work eventually
alfheim.page.infernalSapling2=Planks
alfheim.page.infernalSapling3=Stairs
alfheim.page.infernalSapling4=Slabs
alfheim.page.infernalSapling5=Twigs
alfheim.page.infernalSapling6=Coal
alfheim.page.infernalSapling7=And splinters

alfheim.page.circuitSapling0=The &1Circuitree&0 emits a redstone signal of a strength equal to the number of &1Circuitree&0 blocks consecutively above it. Any block from the tree can be used in the stack, including the sapling.
alfheim.page.circuitSapling1=I deeply apologize for the pun
alfheim.page.circuitSapling2=The planks work too
alfheim.page.circuitSapling3=And Stairs
alfheim.page.circuitSapling4=And even Slabs

alfheim.page.calicoSapling0=The &1Calico Tree&0 is so cat-like, it scares more than just creepers away, it actually scares off any explosion at all. Any block from the tree can be used for this, including the sapling.
alfheim.page.calicoSapling1=Not a scratching post
alfheim.page.calicoSapling2=The planks work too
alfheim.page.calicoSapling3=And Stairs
alfheim.page.calicoSapling4=And even Slabs

alfheim.page.toolbelt0=The &1Botanist's Toolbelt&0 is an easy-access extra inventory. By sneaking, you gain access to 12 extra stacks of storage, which can be used by interacting with the air around where they appear. Any items or blocks in it will provide for the &1Rod of the Shifting Crust&0.
alfheim.page.toolbelt1=Not quite hammerspace

alfheim.page.lamp0=The &1Iridescent Lantern&0 glows with all the colors of the rainbow. While black in appearance when first set down, giving it a redstone signal will change its color. The higher the signal, the farther down the rainbow the color becomes.<br>If given a full signal, the &1Iridescent Lantern&0 will glow like the &4Bifrost&0 itself.
alfheim.page.lamp1=Left by a Piggah

alfheim.page.tctrees0=The &2Garden of Glass&0 is truly empty. It's so devoid of life you can't find even a remnant of the trees considered necessary for the &5Thaumic&0 arts. However, it appears that the shards of magic occasionally produced by the &1Orechid&0 might be of use in recreating these trees. By applying these shards of power via &4Dendric Suffusion&0, you can make what you cannot find.
alfheim.page.tctrees1=That's what she said
alfheim.page.tctrees2=Over 70 rides and attractions
alfheim.page.tctrees3=Forgoing the natural pattern of ingots, leaves, and catalyst, and substituting the power of &1Pixie Dust&0 in their place, it is possible to 'corrupt' an &1Iridescent Sapling&0. This process removes the essence of trees and wood, &4Arbor&0, and replaces it with something else entirely. Using this theorem, the mryiad plants of &5Thaumaturgy&0 can be produced.
alfheim.page.tctrees4=Version control with added snakes
alfheim.page.tctrees5=Burn, baby, burn
alfheim.page.tctrees6=Don't do drugs, kids

alfheim.page.silencer0=The &1Sealing Oak&0 has a strange dampening effect on the air around it. Any sounds within eight blocks of any &4Sealing&0 wood block will sound half as loud as it would have otherwise.
alfheim.page.silencer1=An extra utility
alfheim.page.silencer2=Planks
alfheim.page.silencer3=Slabs
alfheim.page.silencer4=Stairs

alfheim.page.amplifier0=By dampening the air within &1Note Blocks&0, the &1Sonic Amplifier&0 reverberates sound, making sounds within a block or two sound far louder. The more you have, the louder the sound.
alfheim.page.amplifier1=Soaryn + Amp + Cacophonium = Dire rage

alfheim.page.crysanthermum0=The &1Crysanthermum&0 is a hardy flower that can survive in any climate. However, its mana generation isn't indifferent to the climate. By feeding it &1Metamorphic Stone&0, you change its temperature. The farther its temperature is to the biome you're in, the more mana it will generate.
alfheim.page.crysanthermum1=The hotter or colder the biome the stone comes from, the hotter or colder the flower will be after eating that stone. There are, however, a few caveats. Feeding the flower &1Fungal&0 stone can do anything, from cool the flower rapidly to heat it up immensely.
alfheim.page.crysanthermum2=If a flower becomes too cold or too hot, it'll stop working until it gets back to normal temperature. Using a stone that was used within the last eight will give you diminishing returns for the next 8 stones, meaning that you'll occasionally have to course-correct.
alfheim.page.crysanthermum3=Left by a Fortanono

alfheim.page.andmyaxe0=&1Elementium&0 is a highly enchantable substance. So enchantable, in fact, it seems one can enchant it with spells and power outside the normal cycles. By flooding an axe of the stuff with six powers, you have recreated a legendary weapon: the &1Holy Blade Revelation&0. It attacks not the body, but the mind. This has interesting effects when used to attack an immortal.
alfheim.page.andmyaxe1=&1Revelation&0 has two main abilities. It can attack like a sword, and mine like an axe. It cannot, however, recieve any axe enchantments. The other ability is its soul-draining power. Drawing it back, like a bow, will drain a little mana from anyone foolish enough to be within the blade's range. The range increases with time held back.

alfheim.page.starBlock0=The &1Frozen Star&0 is the light of the stars, trapped upon earth. They are relatively cheap light sources, and give off light with the same strength as &1Glowstone&0. Due to their instability, they can only be harvested by players.
alfheim.page.starBlock1=Find Polaris to find your way
alfheim.page.starBlock2=The &1Crackling Star&0 is the form of the stars, trapped upon earth, and brought forth through &4Iridescence&0. They appear as a ball of light, but will distribute their mass to a &1Crackling Star&0 it's bound to with a &1Wand of the Forest&0. They give off light with the same strength as &1Glowstone&0, and can be made in any of the colors of &4Iridescence&0.
alfheim.page.starBlock3=Wire's frames

alfheim.page.dagger0=&1The Dagger of the Perfect Soul&0 is the manifestation of rebellion. It, paradoxically, is stronger when on the defense than on the attack. As a weapon, it's weaker than a sword of wood. When you parry with it, however, if you can block before the blade becomes dun, it will reflect the strength of the attack upon the attacker. It has been said that this blade has freed many from oppression's clutches.

alfheim.page.shimmer0=&1Nether Quartz&0, combined with the energies of the &4Bifrost&0, turns into a variant of quartz displaying all the colors of the rainbow. As with the more mundane quartz varieties, &1Shimmerquartz&0 can be crafted into all its decorative block counterparts just like regular &1Quartz&0 blocks. It cannot be used to make a &1Flügel Tiara&0 variant; something about matrices stops you from doing so.
alfheim.page.shimmer1=Wire's scraping the bottom of the barrel here

alfheim.page.throwablePotions0=By applying &1Gunpowder&0 effect to any &1Vial&0 one can make it explodable on contact with the ground or entities. By reducing the number of uses the speed and size of the AoE are increased.
alfheim.page.throwablePotions1=Incoming!
