botania.tagline.alfheim=New Horizons!
botania.page.alfheim0=Alfheim... A beautiful world where magic lives forever... These lands were given to the light alvs, also called elves. But who are they? Creatures similar to people living for so long that they deserve to be considered immortal, they were created by the first Aesir. The very same world is filled with special magic, which made the world so beautiful.
botania.page.alfheim1=But he also has terrible characteristics: time. Even the time itself in this place is distorted. Many legends go about this place: those who once came to Alfheim, returned from it after decades, although for them the days passed... Those that the travelers knew happened to have been in Helheim or Walhall for a long time... Oh, let the heavenly light shines upon the souls of the dead!

botania.entry.elves=Elves
botania.tagline.elves=Native people
botania.page.elves0=As it was said before, elves are beautiful creatures, spellfully wielding magic, which the first Aesir settled in Alfheim. A great sorcerer and Alfheim-born Mastray was the only one who knew the temporary anomalies of his own world as his five fingers.
botania.page.elves1=His greatest invention was the portal to Midgard, the middle world of the world tree Yggdrasil. This world was not like Alfheim. He studied this world for a week on the Midgard calendar, and during this time met people. Those only heard about the elven kingdom, but now they are eager to get there...
botania.page.elves2=Mastray warned them about the time jump that they will have to endure, and almost everyone listened to his warnings... 30 years passed on Midgard, on Alfhem - only 7 hours. But they were warned, what is their punishment from themselves!
botania.page.elves3=After this incident, the elves sought the most stable lands in their kingdom. In them, when one second passes in Alfhem, a little more than an hour passes on Midgard. So then the great cooperation of elves and people began.
botania.page.elves4=Among the people there were mages who comprehended their craft through flowers. This magic was something similar to elven one. Having studied the precious component of Midgard ores (iron, diamonds and similar jewelry), the elves understood: bargaining with people is profitable. However, their world is not filled with mana like Alfheim. Therefore, they concluded a trade union, which is still valid today.

botania.entry.pylons=New pylons
botania.tagline.pylons=I will command the parade
botania.page.pylons0=There are some changes in pylons you need to get used to:<br>All human pylons has their counterparts in Alfheim: Elven pylon is same tier as Mana pylon; Terra - as Yordin;<br>Gaia pylon is still top-tier, but it's recipe has changed.

botania.entry.portal=Portal to Alfheim
botania.tagline.portal=We need to go even more deeper!
botania.page.portal0=Mastray... He was a native of Alfheim and created the first portal to Midgard, which laid the foundation for a great alliance. However, the portal itself was given to him with great difficulty. To build a portal to Midgard, the resources of Midgard were needed... How ironic... It's good that Freyr himself lived in Alfheim, because he was a race of Vans, another kind of gods...
botania.page.portal1=He understood Mastray, and brought him terrasteel - the great alloy of Midgard. Then he quickly finished the portal and activated it. Apparently, if you build it in Midgard, it will also work...
botania.page.portal2=At the heart of the portal is Bifr√∂st - the legendary rainbow bridge that connects Asgard to other worlds.
botania.page.portal3=The next thing you need is a link that can set up the perfect connection between Alfheim and Midgard. Elves will never tell the secret of making this link to people, and for its manufacture will require the Netherstar - the artifact of Muspelheim. It remains only to build the portal correctly and it's ready!

botania.page.portal6=Portal to Alfheim
botania.page.portal7=To activate the portal, you only need to use the Core on the portal, and operating principle is identical to the portal of livingwood. The only difference is that in Alfheim it doesn't require mana sources, since it takes energy from the world itself.
botania.page.portal8=Unfortunately, it was impossible to create a stable and fully functioning portal even for Mastray. This version can no longer pass the inanimate objects, only beings mentally connected with higher creatures - players. But it successfully compensates temporal anomalies of Alfheim at the price of its integrity if it is not in the center of the world.

While worn, one can press their &4left/right&0 keys (which are &4A and D&0, respectively, by default) to quickly sweep to the side and dodge incoming attacks or mobs.<br>The dodge ability goes through a short cooldown before it can be used again, and uses up some of the user's hunger bar.

This will set the block that will be placed.<br>Shift-right clicking with the astrolabe on the air will change how many blocks will get placed.
botania.page.astrolab1=When looking at a block with the astrolabe in hand, a quick preview will show up, of what blocks will be placed upon right click.<br>To create the wall or floor displayed, alongside &4Mana&0, the respective blocks will be taken from the user's inventory, or items that can provide blocks to items such as the &1Rod of the Shifting Crust&0.

botania.entry.ores=Ores
botania.tagline.ores=Make even more filters...
botania.page.ores0=Everyone knows that the midges of Midgard are filled with ores and minerals. This is clearly seen when miners extract new pieces of iron, gold or diamonds. However, what about Alfheim? They have their own ores that they traded with the people of Midgard.<br>Elementium ore is a magical metal ore that is pure and beautiful... Stunning metal!
botania.page.ores1=Dragonstone ore - precious pink elven jewel. It is a pity that you can not make the tools out of it.<br>Gold ore - looks like the elves had the metal of the gods too...<br>Elven quartz ore - it's like the quartz from the nether, a beautiful green color, like Alfheim itself!
botania.page.ores2=Iffesal ore - only a few people have heard about it. It is believed that its dust has a great power, and greatest elven inventions are based on it. The elves themselves are aware of the greed and profit thirst for people, so they don't want to bargain with it.

botania.entry.mobs=Mobs
botania.tagline.mobs=Finally, life!
botania.page.mobs0=Alfheim, unlike Midgard, is not such a forgotten world. After all, there still live indigenous people - elves! It's good that they haven't lost their mind, otherwise we know the former natives of Midgard - zombies. Elves are the greatest sorcerers, and they are revered by everyone. They were, it until they got infected with that terrible virus... But somehow they are not inclined to talk with you...
botania.page.mobs1=Also in the world can fly special little purple creatures, which are called pixies, otherwise - fairies. Kind - yes. Valuable - yes, because their dust is used in various crafting recipes. Elves used this ingredient to trade it for manapearls...

botania.entry.pixie=Pixie Attaractor

botania.entry.infuser=Infusion
botania.tagline.infuser=Almost like Thaumcraft
botania.page.infuser0=Basic filling with mana is the basis of all botanical magic. Is it difficult to just throw an item in the mana pool to just fill it? Everyone will say at once: it's easy! However, the elves went further. Their goal was to create a special device that allows filling one object with the properties of others and mana. Just like Thaumaturges of Midgard.
botania.page.infuser1=Nevertheless, this required the most valuable dust - the Iffesal. It doesn't just symbolize power - it IS power, but in a crystallized form. What about pixies dust? It is the basis of what was called the core of the mana-infuser.

botania.page.infuser3=Creating &1Mana-infuser&0
botania.page.infuser4=It turned out perfectly, but it is not enough. Now we need to put this cherished bloc in the world and build on its basis a structure!

botania.tagline.elvorium=Better than terrasteel
botania.page.elvorium0=Elves had learned the recipe of the terrasteel, the one that Mastray had borrowed from Freyr. However, long before that, elves had a similar method of making an alloy woven from the power of Alfheim's resources. By properties, it is similar to terrasteel, but stronger... Elementium ingot, piece of dragonstone, pixie dust and some mana. Here it is, the cherished alloy! Elvorium!

botania.entry.trade=Reverse Exchange
botania.tagline.trade=Well, how else?
botania.page.trade0=Alfheim sometimes impresses with its anomalies, but precisely because of them it is possible to create a portal into this world. The trading gate used by the traders of Midgard is built in Alfheim in a different way, because of those anomalies not allowing the work of a scheme that operates in Overworld. But Mastray did not lose it.
botania.page.trade1=The Alfheim-Midgard portal itself is similar in design to the portal of Midgard-Alfheim, but there are some differences:<br>The material for its gate won't be livingwood, but a livingrock, and elven pylons of elvorium and Iffesal dust will perfectly stabilize the connection. May the great Mastray, the Connector of the Worlds, be glorified forever!

botania.entry.essences=Essences
botania.tagline.essences=It looks like corals
botania.page.essences0=When you travel to the Nether, you realize that this is only part of Muspelheim. From Elven Lore it is clear why the nether portals function: Muspelheim has approached Midgard.<br>But when you read legends about the universe, you remember about Niflheim, the world of frosts and ice, on a pair with Muspelheim occupying the status of "primal".
botania.page.essences2=Everything was not as trivial as one would like. Apparently, the only source of the essences of the worlds were the Fl√ºgels, which collected it in plenty during the Great War. May the gods help you in getting it.
botania.page.essences2u=&oBut how to get their powers?&r
botania.page.essences4=Terrasteel and Elvorium are ideal alloys, symbolizing the power of Midgard and Alfheim. But it's still far from the limit! We all know what will happen if we combine the Gaia Spirit and the Terrestrial - Gaia ingot. A dummy, it would seem. But the elves consider differently...
botania.page.essences5=Legends of Asgard say: the weapons of the gods are woven of a special metal, uniting the forces of the four worlds. The elves took into account these legends and decided to become like the gods in this. They have woven two alloys from the elvorium and essences of the primal worlds, similarly to Gaia ingots: an ingots of Muspelheim's and Niflheim's powers.
botania.page.essences6=Creating &1World's Powers Ingots&1
botania.page.essences7=But they didn't stop on this and went even further, combining the ingots with Gaia's ingot and making Elven infusion. The metal of the gods themselves - &6Mauftrium&0. True power in this alloy!

botania.page.runes2=The new runes of Muspelheim and Niflheim contain in themselves their original energy, which makes it possible to create powerful weapons of fire and ice... May the sleeping giants of both worlds awake!
botania.page.runes3=But besides the runes of these worlds, there is one more. The rune of five elements: air, fire, water, earth and magic, also called the &5Primordial Rune&0. Such a rune contains the power of the original energy, which was before the time of these two worlds. Wait a second, was there really a time when Muspelheim and Niflheim did not exist? Who knows...

botania.page.elvenSet0=The sorcerers of Midgard used the powers given by nature to achieve their goals. They created terrasteel and runes, for what? For the sake of the perfect armor the of nature, the Terrasteel armor.

botania.page.advMana1=As it turned out, the dragonstone can absorb mana, but it quickly loses it. The elves strengthened this stone with the valuable Iffesal dust, and created a mana-stone that allows you to store mana four times more than that stone tablet. And with the discovery of the essences of the primal worlds, the elven magicians strengthened it even more. The result is an improved storage of mana.

botania.page.ruling1=Using the Mauftrium and Blazerods, the Elves were able to concentrate the power of the runes and use it to their advantage. The rods of two worlds allow the creation of protective circles - from the red flame of Muspelheim or the poisonous ice of Niflheim. Fortunately or unfortunately, they are short-lived, but there will be enough time for regrouping.

botania.page.reality0=Elemental elven armor is certainly a good idea... But for a warrior with such armor there is not enough weapons. Let's say a sword. Fortunately this problem is solvable with the use of the alloy of the gods! The sword itself can either be a simple cutting blade, or it can erupt from itself the strength of one of the four primal elements.
botania.page.reality1=But we must take into account that when you set the sword to one of these elements, mana is wasted, so take care of it! But it's not important, because you have a lot of it, considering that you created so much Mauftrium for this sword, right?

Their ability to teleport in the places they've seen previously has attracted many brave explorers, but not everyone decides to challenge Gaia's Guardian to get one of their eyes.
botania.page.flugel1=Fl√ºgels themselves strongly hate Guardians, for the fact that they took away eyes from their dead relatives, and are trying their best to return the relics. And it can be used to your advantage. Replacing the sacrificial ingot at the eye of the Fl√ºgel in the ritual of Gaia, built in the clouds, you can summon one of the Fl√ºgels and try to defeat it.
botania.page.flugel2=But be careful - their self-love will not allow them to fight with someone who can not fly by themselves, so you need to get wings like theirs. Good armor, strong sword and potions - without them you are unlikely to achieve anything. Otherwise, an inquisitive and flexible mind will help you.

botania.page.soul4=Soul restructurizer
botania.page.soul5=In order to restore the soul, it is enough to place it in the upper part of the brewery and summon the Gaia Guardian. Anti-pylons will do the rest for you. For sure success, call the hardcore form of the Guardian. But if you are lucky, then the usual form will help, it is like a coin toss. But be careful.
